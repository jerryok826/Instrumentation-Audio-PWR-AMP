## Project Description
I needed a audio amp I could use to speakers and haptic. Most amps today seem to be class D. Some form PWM output drive. These can not eadlierd be tested with a acope. So I was looking for a class AB amp. The old LM1875 meate thses reuireemsts. The spec I was looking for were running of of 12 volts. DC direct dirve of the speakers so it could revirewd with a scope. Also I wanted a calibrated gain
