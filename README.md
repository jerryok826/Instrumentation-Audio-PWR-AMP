## Project Description
I needed a audio amp I could use to test speakers and haptic. Most amps today seem to be class D. Some form PWM output drive. These becannot easily be tested with a scope. So I was looking for a class AB amp. The old LM1875 meet these requirements. The other specs I was looking for were running from 12 volts. DC direct dirve of the speakers so it could reviewed with a scope. Also I wanted a calibrated gain. The design uses a on baord 12 volt to -12v converted to generated the required negative supply voltage. The DC offset at the speaker drive is about 1 millvolt.

### Project Status
The project is basically complete.

## Design Files
This project was designed with Kicad 7.X
