## Project Description
I always thought that most laborary power supplies (LPS) take up to much bench space. This design is just 2.5 inches by 5.5 inches and runs off a wall wart or it can be powered from a lithium battery pack. The unit's specs are 0 to 15 volts output with a maximum output current of 1.5 amps. It has two output adjustable 

### Project Status
The project is basically complete. I am working on converting the design to Kicad and STM32 IDE Cube.

## Design Files
### Electrical Design Files
This project was initially designed with Altium Designer and is now being updated with Kicad 7.X The control software is C code runing on FreeRTOS.
