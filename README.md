## Project Description
I needed a audio amp I could use to test speakers and haptics. Most audio amps today seem to be class D with some form PWM output drive. These cannot be easily be tested with a scope. So I started looking for a linear class AB audio amp. The old LM1875 meet these requirements. The other specs I was looking for were running from 12 volts. Also DC direct dirve of the speakers so the amps performanceit could verified with a scope. Also I wanted a calibrated gain. The design uses a on board 12 volt to -12v converted to generated the required negative supply voltage. The DC offset at the speaker drive is about 1 millvolt. With the attuation pot set to 100% the input to out gain is 10.

### Project Status
The project is basically complete.
